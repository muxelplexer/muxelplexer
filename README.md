# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name's Sebastian but these days i go by _muxelplexer_ on the net.
I finished High School with a diploma in network engineering but then started developing for a
medical C# mobile application. Now i'm a C/C++ Developer in a codebase extending the Siemens NX Environment.

Currently trying to get more into systems and operating systems development
