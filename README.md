# Hello there General Kenobi ðŸ‘‹

You stumbled onto my profile... congrats!  
Now you obviously wonder if there is anything interesting... right?  

## Quick Introduction

My name is Sebastian Muxel and i'm a 21 year old software engineer from Vorarlberg, Austria ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¹  
I'm mostly developing in C++ as that is the language i started programming and got my current job with.  
In my free-time i organize events and DJ Drum and Bass music.

## Non Programming Projects

In my free time i administrate [larkspur](https://larkspur.one): a free multi-service hosted by myself.  
It currently has following services running:  

- [fediverse](https://larkspur.one)  
    The main domain directly serves the running Akkoma Instance. Logins are currently on a aprooval basis as i could not be arsed enough to setup a working e-mail server yet.
- [gitea](https://git.larkspur.one)  
    Larkspur users can message me for access to the gitea instance. A mostly locked down private instance for source code hosting.


## Some Notable Projects
- [**termNote**](https://github.com/muxelplexer/termNote)

    A simple C++20 library for reading and loading .env files into the local environment.  
- [**ldapp**](https://git.larkspur.one/muxelplexer/ldapp)
