# Hello there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sebastian Muxel, better known as `muxelplexer` on the internet.
If you want to know any more about me, feel free to contact me at my e-mail or check out [my blog]().

## Spotlight

Some of my projects i like to highlight:

- [**dotenv**](https://github.com/muxelplexer/dotenv)  
    A simple C++20 library for reading and loading .env files into the local environment.  
- [**termNote**](https://github.com/muxelplexer/termnote)  
    One of my first projects i have gotten actual personal use out of. Started as a project to solve my long lasting
    issues with physical post-it notes it has grown to a point where it helped me get through most of my time in education
    by screaming at me through any terminal i have opened. Due to the low-quality codebase and the missing personal use
    it is still here for archival purposes.
- [**larkspur**](https://larkspur.one)  
    Larkspur is the name for the couple services i run publicly on my server. Currently there is an Akkoma instance allowing
    access to the federated ActivityPub social networks. There is also a Git server and a backend system in place.

## Non Programming Projects

In my free time i administrate [larkspur](https://larkspur.one): a free multi-service hosted by myself.  
It currently has following services running:  

- [fediverse](https://larkspur.one)  
    The main domain directly serves the running Akkoma Instance. Logins are currently on a aprooval basis as i could not be arsed enough to setup a working e-mail server yet.
- [gitea](https://git.larkspur.one)  
    Larkspur users can message me for access to the gitea instance. A mostly locked down private instance for source code hosting.
